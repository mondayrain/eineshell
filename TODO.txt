- Env var to work on OSX
- Get rid of redundant local ENV VARs, e.g. we don't need a local PWD and OLD_PWD (comes with operating system)
- Parse arguments correctly into an array that can be handed to execve
- Implement chdir
- Implement setenv
- Set up signal handler, so we can handle ctrl-x, ctrl-c, etc
- Properly hold/display child and parent PIDs
